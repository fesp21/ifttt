# [WIP] Deploying to Wikimedia Labs

We are in the process of moving the IFTTT channel to a standalone service on Wikimedia Labs from tool labs. The new deployment process is explained here, and might evolve.

The staging server for dev(ifttt-dev channel) is setup at ifttt-staging-01.eqiad.wmflabs, the public endpoint is hosted at ifttt-dev.wmflabs.org
The prod server will be at ifttt-01.eqiad.wmflabs(ifttt prod channel), public endpoint is at ifttt.wmflabs.org

To create your own test instance, create an instance in the ifttt labs project, and apply the role::ifttt::staging puppet role to initialize the repo, and have necessary packages installed on the server. Add your host to the STAGES config in the fabfile.

* To list all fabric actions: `fab -list`
```
ifttt [master] fab -list
Available commands:

    deploy             Deploys updated code to the web server
    initialize_server  Setup an initial deployment on a fresh host.
    production
    restart_ifttt      Restarts the ifttt web sersive
    staging
```

* To initialize server (Needs to be done only the first time after setting up server through puppet):
`fab <staging|production> initialize_server`.
```
ifttt [master] fab staging initialize_server --hide everything --show user
